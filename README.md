## 📘 WebCue Docs

### 🔍 Overview

WebCue is a web-based alternative to QLab, designed to run audio and lighting cues directly in your browser. It’s perfect for live performances, theater productions, or any event needing a cool "GO" button.

> _"Why use WebCue? It's a ‘cue’-less decision 😄."_

---

### ✨ Features

- **Cue Management**: Manual or auto-advance cues. Like a playlist, but fewer awkward song choices.
- **Lighting Integration**: Control QLC+ via web interface. _No disco ball required._
- **File Upload**: Upload audio folders (Chrome/Edge) or individual files (others).
- **BETA Features**: Swipe/arrow key shortcuts. Still buggy... use at your own risk.
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Works, but Firefox/Safari need extra patience. Just use Chrome/Edge. Please and thank you.

### 🚀 Quick Start Guide

1. **Open WebCue**: [Launch WebCue](https://therealduckers.github.io/WebCue)
2. **Pick Your Browser Mode**:
   - **Chromium (Chrome/Edge)**: Upload a **folder**. Easy.
   - **Others**: Upload **files**.
3. **Create Cues**:
   - Rename, add notes, set **Follow** (Auto/Manual).
   - **QLC+ Lighting**: see separate instructions below...
4. **Save/Load Shows**: "Save Show" → "Load Show" → re-upload files/allow directory accsess (told you it would be easier)
5. **Hit GO**:
   - Click, spacebar, or **swipe left** (BETA).
   - **Fade**: on current selected cue (use up and down arrow keys to select cues)
   - **Stop**: Pretty obvious if you ask me....
6. **Tips**:
   - Auto-match cues to files. (don't need the same name on file as in WebCue...again, use chrome/edge and use a folder)
   - _"If it glitches, it’s a feature, not a bug… right?"_ (just hurry up and report it...)

### 🎭 Use Cases

- **Theater Productions**: Sync sound effects, music, and stage lighting.  
  _Example_: Cue a thunderstorm sound + dim lights. (yes, that is the start of the Percy Jackson musical...)

- **Live Music**: Trigger backing tracks and spotlights.  
  _Example_: Guitar solo → spotlight + delay effect.

- **Podcasts**: Play sound effects on cue.  
  _Example_: "Dramatic pause" → suspenseful music.

### 💡 QLC+ Integration

1. Launch QLC+ with `--web`.
2. Create a function, grab the ID (e.g., `startfunction:1`).
3. Paste the number (1 in this case) into WebCue’s lighting field.

> _"Boom. Lights. 🎉"_

### ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts (BETA only)

- **Left Arrow**: GO — _"Like advancing a cringe slideshow."_
- **Right Arrow**: Fade — _"Like fading into the shadows… gracefully."_
- **Swipe**: Mobile magic. Don’t trip.

---

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **Files Not Loading?**: Re-upload, or press GO and wait a minute. It's slow on first load.  
  _"Restart the Wi-Fi. Or the universe."_

- **Other Errors? Oh, goodie...**
